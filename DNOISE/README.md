| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **Clean Implementation:** A clean and orderly implementation makes D-NOISE more convenient than the default Cycles denoiser. Easily access the denoiser from the UV/Image editor or the render layers tab of the properties panel. | ![alt text](https://remingtongraphics.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DNOISE_FeaturedImage.png)|
| ![alt text](https://remingtongraphics.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Denoise-Time-Table-min.jpg) | **Takes Seconds:** GPU-acceleration enables the underlying AI denoiser to accurately eliminate noise from your renders in no more than a few seconds. |
| **Denoise Anything**: D-NOISE isn’t exclusive to renders like the Cycles denoiser is. D-NOISE can run on any image loaded into the UV/Image Editor including texture bakes and even photos! | ![alt text](https://remingtongraphics.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Image-Denoise-min.png) |
